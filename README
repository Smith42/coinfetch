coinfetch
=========

See [INSTALL](INSTALL) for installation instructions.

Using `coinfetch`
-----------------

coinfetch takes two arguments from the command line, and returns a conversion 
factor.

The arguments are the three-letter identifiers of various currencies.

Many (but not all) pairs of coins can be used.

Example: `$ coinfetch usd btc`

The above example will return the amount of Bitcoin that can currently be
bought with one United States dollar.

If the coins are reversed (e.g. `$ coinfetch btc usd`), the amount of United
States dollars that can currently be bought with one Bitcoin will be returned.

As of version 2.x, you may optionally add a third argument before the first
currency in order to multiply that amount.

Example: `$ coinfetch 1000 ltc usd`

The above example will return the value of 1000 LTC in USD.

Limitations
-----------

As of version 3.x, this script now uses the BTC-E API instead of BTer, on
account of BTer's API server being unreliable. The sacrifice made in this
change is slower performance when the first currency pair isn't found and also
lack of support for Dogecoin (which we at Delwink do love so much).

If you find a way to get around these, please [let us know][1]!
