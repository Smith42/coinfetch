coinfetch
=========

See [INSTALL](INSTALL) for installation instructions.

Using `coinfetch`
-----------------

coinfetch takes two arguments from the command line, and returns a conversion 
factor.

The arguments are the three-letter identifiers of various currencies.

Many (but not all) pairs of coins can be used.

Example: `$ coinfetch usd btc`

The above example will return the amount of Bitcoin that can currently be
bought with one United States dollar.

If the coins are reversed (e.g. `$ coinfetch btc usd`), the amount of United
States dollars that can currently be bought with one Bitcoin will be returned.

As of version 2.x, you may optionally add a third argument before the first
currency in order to multiply that amount.

Example: `$ coinfetch 1000 ltc usd`

The above example will return the value of 1000 LTC in USD.

As of version 4.x, you will be able to use `coinfetch` with many ticker APIs
with the `-a` option.

Example: `$ coinfetch -a bter usd doge`

The above example will be the same as calling `coinfetch usd doge` in version
2.x, which used the BTer API. The default API is BTC-E.
